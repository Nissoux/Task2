                    ’s back on Twitch, exclusively, in a multiyear deal with the site. It’s another big move for Tyler “Ninja” Blevins,
                    who’s had quite a year even aside from the ongoing pandemic. Last August, he left <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_(service)">Twitch</a>
                    for an exclusive deal with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixer_(service)">Mixer</a>
                    — which shut down at the end of June, scrapped for parts over at Facebook Gaming. He walked away from the wreckage in
                    much better shape 
                    than the rest of his peers on the site (save for Michael <a href="https://twitter.com/shroud">“Shroud”</a>
                    Grzesiek), reportedly with the full amount of his seven-figure contract in his pockets. 
                    And today, Blevins comes home to Twitch.

                <p>
                    Microsoft flinched first, and now we know how much the next generation of console gaming will cost. The <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/consoles/xbox-series-s">Xbox Series S</a>
                    and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/consoles/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X</a>
                    will officially 
                    launch November 10th starting at $299, the company announced this week, after spending 15 months revealing details about its next-generation Xbox in 
                    dribs and drabs.<br>Any questions remain, like whether the $299 Xbox Series S will truly feel next-gen, since it’ll only have a third the raw GPU performance of the $499 Xbox 
                    Series X and less than half that of the PlayStation 5. (They’re all based on the same AMD RDNA 2 graphics architecture.)
